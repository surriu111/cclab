                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                She relies on human being's emotion and thoughts to grow.
                She only appears in a higher dimension but we can see the projection of it on our 2d screen with certain
                technology.

                How do we interact with this creature?

            <p>
                Try to add some inputs in the field below the canvas and see what will happen. I am not going to
                instruct you a lot, it will all depend on whether she
                is willing to play with you or not.
